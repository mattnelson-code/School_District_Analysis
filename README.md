# School District Analysis with Pandas 

## Overview of Project

* Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, needs to analyze data on student funding and standardized test scores
* Maria needs help analyzing the data to provide insight about performance trends and patterns
* These insights will inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level 

### Additional Overview 

* Thomas HS 9th grade test scores have been altered, which means they should be removed from the initial analysis 
* New results should be presented

### Purpose

* To aggregate the data to showcase trends in school performance
* Provide data analysis that will aid Maria and the school board to make decisions on school budgets and priorities 
* Update data analysis by removing Thomas HS 9th grade test scores from the data and presenting the new results

2. Thomas HS's Average Math Score decreases, while its Average Reading Score increases.
3. Thomas HS sees a 0.32% decrease in % Overall Passing. 
4. Relative to other schools, Thomas HS remains second in overall passing percentage. However, after the change, Thomas HS leads Griffin High School by a small margin (0.03%). 

## Conclusion

1. Removing Thomas HS ninth grade scores altered the results but not significantly. There are slight changes to the district summary. In addition, the results from Thomas HS differ from the initial analysis, such as the 0.32% decrease in % Overall Passing. 
2. Overall, the removal did not impact the data significantly. No changes in the data for the sections Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by Schoool Type, demonstrate the validity of this claim.
